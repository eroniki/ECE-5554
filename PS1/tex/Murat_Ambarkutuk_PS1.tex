\label{Short Answer Problems}
\section{Short Answer Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
	% 1- Give an example of how one can exploit the associative property of
	% convolution to more efficiently filter an image.
	\item The computational complexity of convolution for any arbitrary
	kernel ${F_0}_{[m\times n]}$ and image ${I_0}_{[M\times N]}$:
	$$\mathcal{O}(MNmn)$$
	Hence, applying various filters will drastically increase
	the computational cost of filtering process.\\
	For instance, ${F_0}_{[m\times n]} \ast ({F_1}_{[m\times n]} \ast
	{I_0}_{[M\times N]})$ will be computed with the complexity of $2 \times
	\mathcal{O}(MNmn)$. \\
	On the other hand, associative property of convolution can be
	utilizied by convolving the filters first, then applying the acquired filter to
	image:
	$({F_0}_{[m\times n]} \ast {F_1}_{[m\times n]}) \ast
	{I_0}_{[M\times N]}$ $$\mathcal{O}(m^2n^2) + \mathcal{O}(MNmn)$$
	Given that in any filtering process the size of filter
	kernel, by its nature, will be smaller than the image size, the computational
	complexity will be reduced thanks to the assosicative property of convolution.
	$$\mathcal{O}{(m^2n^2)} + \mathcal{O}(MNmn) \ll 2 \times \mathcal{O}(MNmn)$$
	% 2- This is the input image: [0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1]. What is the result of dilation
	% with a structuring element [1 1 1]?
	\item 
	$$\vec{I} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}
	, \vec{f}= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
	\begin{equation} 
	\begin{split}
	\vec{H} & = \vec{I} \bigoplus \vec{f} \\
	& = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1  \end{bmatrix}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	% 3- The filter f’ = [0 -1/2 0 1/2 0] gives an estimate of the first derivative
	% of the image in the x direction.
	% What is the corresponding second derivative filter f". (Hint: Assymetric
	% filters must be flipped prior to convolution.)
	\item $\vec{f''} = \begin{bmatrix}  \frac{-1}{4} & 0 &
	\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{-1}{4}\end{bmatrix}$ (After discussing the question
	with Yazhe Hu and Tian Yi regarding the discussion conducted on the forum,
	I changed my answer according to Prof. Parikh's prompt.) 
	% 4- Name two specific ways in which one could reduce the amount of fine, detailed edges that are detected
	% with the Canny edge detector.
	\item % TODO Read the Canny Edge Detection algorithm
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Gaussian Kernel: Canny edge detection algorithm utilizes Gaussian
		filter to reduce noise. However, too big kernel will smooth out some of the
		detail in the input image. In that case, output image would have fewer fine
		edges.
		\item Wrong Thresholding: Setting too high numbers for high and low threshold
		would reduce the amount of fine and detailed edges. These values set the
		overall performance of the algorithm in the steps of double thresholding and
		hysteresis edge tracking. 
		% In the double thresholding step, any pixel whose
		% gradient magnitude is above than higher threshold is marked as 'strong
		% edges', while any pixel whose gradient value is within the high and low
		% threshold range, marked 'candidate edges'. On the other hand, all the pixels
		% whose gradient magnitude is below than low threshold are subject
		% elemination.
		In the double thresholding step, pixels are marked and categorized according
		to their gradient magnitude. Setting too high threshold values would miss some
		of the fine, detailed edges since they might have lower gradient magnitude
		values than high threshold value. Likewise, too high threshold
		values would have impact on performance of hysteresis edge tracking step.
	\end{enumerate}
	% 5- Describe a possible flaw in the use of additive Gaussian noise to
	% represent image noise.
	% TODO Additive Gaussian Noise, mean zero
	\item In real world applications noise occuring in the image may vary
	depending on many variables, namely, the lightning conditions of the
	environment in which the camera set up or the type of sensor that are being
	used. For that reason, modeling the noise with Gaussian noise may not describe
	the real world for each case of application. 
	% 6- Design a method that takes video data from a camera perched above a conveyor belt at an automotive
	% equipment manufacturer, and reports any flaws in the assembly of a part. Your
	% response should be a list of concise, specific steps, and should incorporate
	% several techniques covered in class thus far.
	% Specify any important assumptions your method makes. 
	% TODO Revise the solution flow
	\item A tentative flow of solution can be used for many generic vision
	problems:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Pre-processing (Preparation)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Data acquisition
			\item Data reduction (Downsampling, color space change \\

	    				\item Feature (Color, geometry, edge, depth \ldots) based (Connected
	    				Components may be utilized with the combination of thresholding)
	    				\item Texture based  				
	    			\end{itemize}
	    		\item Defect detection on the detected object
	    			\begin{itemize}
	    				\item Feature based
	    					\begin{itemize}
	    						\item Color consistency 
	    						\item Geometrical Properties (Hough circles and/or lines can be fitted to check shape defects)
	    						\item Depth data also may give hint on the surface imperfections
	    					\end{itemize}
	    				\item Texture based (Imperfections would change the texture	statistics)

	\item 
	% 3- Display in your answer sheet: (a) the energy function output for the
	% provided image inputSeamCarvingPrague.jpg, and (b) the two corresponding cumulative minimum
	% energy maps for the seams in each direction (use the Matlab’s imagesc or
	% Python’s matplotlib.pyplot.imshow).
	% Explain why these outputs look the way they do given the original image’s
	% content.
	\listFigure{cumulatives.png}{Input Image, Energy Map and
	Cumulative Energy Functions}{cumulatives}	
	As seen on Figure-\ref{fig:cumulatives}, the elements of horizontal cumulative
	energy map is increasing through west to east direction since it is the same
	direction which the algorithm adds up minimum 8-connected element computed in the previous step. \\
	Likewise, the elements in vertical cumulative energy map is increasing in
	north to south direction. \\
	Due to the fact that energy level of each pixel is not still, the final
	distribution of accummulated energy levels vary. The horizontal cumulative
	energy map adds up the bottom region since the ripples of the water surface
	and the reflection caused by these ripples creates high differences among
	neighboring pixels. Along with that, the lowest region of the same map is
	where all the pixels related to sky were add up.
	\pagebreak

	\item
	% 4- For the same image inputSeamCarvingPrague.jpg, display the original image
	% together with (a) the first selected horizontal seam and (b) the first selected
	% vertical seam in your answer sheet. Explain why these are the optimal seams for this image.
	\listFigure{seams.png}{Red Pixels: Optimal Vertical Seam, Blue
	Pixels: Optimal Horizontal Seam}{seams}
	As the cumulative energy maps show in Figure-\ref{fig:cumulatives}, eastern
	part of the horizontal cumulative energy map and southern part of the vertical
	cumulative energy map display the highest energy accumulation, where dynamic
	programming algorithm accumulates the energy differences of neighboring pixels.
	Starting from minima the last row or column of cumulative energy map, the
	algorithm finds the lowest energy accumulation within 8-connected neighbors.
	This way, the algorithm tries to find the seam which connects the lowest energy pixels without leaving the
	8-connected region. \\
	In other words, the algorithm chooses the lowest energy
	elements by finding from most bottom row or from most right column, for
	vertical or horizontal resizing, respectively. The algorithm then proceeds
	choosing one row above or one column left with the same procedure. \\
	Hence, the algorithm finally results finding the seam which connecting lowest
	energy elements without choosing too far away elements.
	(Please see: Figure-\ref{fig:seams})
	\item
	% 5- Make some change to the way the energy function is computed (i.e., filter
	% used, its parameters, or incorporating some other prior knowledge). Display the result and
	% explain the impact on the results for some example in your answer sheet. You need not submit this code.
	New energy function used is Laplacian of Gaussian;
	\begin{lstlisting}
	function energyMap = energy_image(im)
	%%% New Energy Function Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
	frameGray = rgb2gray(im);  
	LoG = conv2(fspecial('laplacian'),fspecial('gaussian'));
	energyMap = imfilter(frameGray, LoG); 
	end		
	\end{lstlisting}	
	\listFigure{cumulatives-2.png}{New Cumulative Energy Map with
	LoG}{cumulatives2}
	As Figure-\ref{fig:cumulatives2} illustrates; applying LoG filter rather than
	Prewitt makes algorithm less aware of the changes since, Gaussian has smoothing
	effect. Thus, the position of first seams drastically changed. To see the
	change please compare \ref{fig:seams} and \ref{fig:seams2}.
    \listFigure{seams-2.png}{The first seams with LoG, Red and Blue Pixels
    depict Optimal and Horizontal Vertical Seams, respectively.}{seams2}
    
	\item Qualitative Results
	% 6- Now, for the real results! Use your system with different kinds of images
	% and seam combinations, and see what kind of interesting results it can produce. The goal is
	% to form some perceptually pleasing outputs where the resizing better preserves content than a blind resizing would, as well as
	% some examples where the output looks unrealistic or has artifacts.
	% Include results for at least three images of your own choosing. Include an
	% example or two of a "bad" outcome. Be creative in the images you choose, and in the amount of combined vertical and horizontal
	% carvings you apply. Try to predict types of images where you might see
	% something interesting happen.
	% It’s ok to fiddle with the parameters (seam sequence, number of seams, etc) to
	% look for interesting and explainable outcomes.
	% For each result, include the following things, clearly labeled:
	% (a) the original input image.
	% (b) your system’s resized image,
	% (c) the result one would get if instead a simple resampling were used (via
	% Matlab’s imresize or Python’s scipy.misc.imresize)
	% (d) the input and output image dimensions,
	% (e) the sequence of removals that were used
	% (f) a qualitative explanation of what we’re seeing in the output.

		\item N. Korea Shot Taken From ISS (\textbf{Partially Failed!})	\href{https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/crowdsourcing_night_images}{Source}
		\\ Because the glare on the eastern side of Earth is relatively smooth (see
		Figure-\ref{fig:inputNorthKorea}), the algorithm carved through that area to
		protect to content of the image while reducing the width (see
		Figure-\ref{fig:outputNorthKoreaW}). While this behavior of the algorithm is
		expected to be seen to some extent, 100 pixel width reduction created a
		artifact over that atmospheric region. \\
		On the other hand, resizing the height of the image succeeds by eleminating
		the dark pixels of space. After this operation, the view gains more cinematic
		view thanks to the new aspect ratio and enables viewers to visulize the
		vast-depth of space. (see Figure-\ref{fig:outputNorthKoreaH}) \\
		For both outputs, the pixels belonging to North Korea are subject to erosion
		(besides Pyongyang, the capital), since the gradient of that area is not high
		as the neighboring regions.	\\	
		In conclusion, Seam Carving displayed better performance while reducing the
		height than Matlab did (see Figure-\ref{fig:outputNorthKoreaMatlab}).

		\item Central Park, Manhattan
		\href{http://animalnewyork.com/2013/awesome-map/}{Source} \\
		This image was chosen intentionally since the content has the lowest gradient
		region, while background has the highest. Therefore it is expected to see that
		the algorithm would try to keep background (in this case the blocks of
		Manhattan) while deleting seams mostly regions where Central Park can be seen.
		The result, on the other hand, confirmed the theory to some extent. Width
		resizing operation was suprisingly accomplished
		(Figure-\ref{fig:outputManhattanW} and Figure-\ref{fig:outputManhattanIOW}).
		As opposed to successful utilization of width resizing, the algorithm could
		not perform the same qualitative result in the height reducing for Central
		Park image (Figure-\ref{fig:outputManhattanH} and
		Figure-\ref{fig:outputManhattanIOH}). The main reason that make the algorithm
		fail may be the aspect ratio of the input image. Since the height of source
		image is 360 pixels, removing 100 pixels force algorithm to remove seams
		passing through Central Park. To eleminate that kind of failure scenarios, a
		qualitative parameter could be introduced to impede the algorithm from
		deleting seams passing through main object.

		\href{http://animalnewyork.com/2013/awesome-map/}{Source} \\ 
		This image is used to analyze the performance of the algorithm where the
		content provides many edges creating big variances in the energy image.
		Considering that these variances will be added up in the cumulative energy map
		to find optimal seams, the algorithm is expected to have diffuculties for
		choosing the seam connecting the lowest energy regions. \\
		As it can be seen in  output image depicted
		in Figure-\ref{fig:outputPennStationW} and the comparison image depicted in
		Figure-\ref{fig:outputPennStationIOW}, the algorithm exploited the fact that
		the picture is old and folded. The content has many details
		created by difference in the illumination which resulted in high contrast and
		detailed edges in the roof regions, while the floor and walls are depicted
		relatively smooth the picture is faded in these areas.
		Finally, the seam carving algorithm could successively resize the input

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{3}
	\item \textbf{Width Increasing by Seam Carving} \\
	The code below (Function-\ref{code:increase}) utilizes the general steps of
	Seam Carving algorithm except adding pixels where the seam passed through by averaging the east and weast
	neighbors of the individual pixel.
	$$\forall\vec{I[i]} = [I[i][1:j], mean(I[i][j-1],I[i][j+1]),
	I[i][j+1:end]]$$
	where i is the i\textsuperscript{th} row of the image
	and j is the optimal seam position for that row. The input image is depicted in
	Figure-\ref{fig:inputSeamCarvingPrague}, while output can be seen in
	Figure-\ref{fig:increaseWidth}.
	\label{code:increase}
	\lstinputlisting{../matlab/increaseWidthGreedy.m}
	\listFigure{increaseWidth.png}{Width
	Increased Image}{increaseWidth} 
	\listFigure{outputIncreaseWidthComparisonOutputsPrague.png}{Comparison
	between Input and Output}{outputIncreaseWidthComparisonOutputsPrague}
	
	\item \textbf{The Greedy Approach} \\
	The code below (Function-\ref{code:greedy}) facilitates the process by reducing
	the processed data by eleminating computing the cumulative energy map. Instead
	of computing that vast amount of data, the greedy approach starts finding
	minimum values for each row at the first row. The algorithm then proceeds
	finding minimum 8-connected neighbors of that individual pixel until reaches to
	the last row.
	Albeit faster (see Figure-\ref{fig:profile}) than the dynamic programming
	solution, it is prone to local minimas while finding seams. This
	probable proneness of error has resulted in low-quality resizing cases. Such
	cases can be seen in Figure-\ref{fig:outputWidthPrague} in the form of bent

	Along with these qualitative results, Figure-\ref{fig:profile} clearly shows
	that the latter algorithm spends four times more time while creating cumulative energy maps, while the greedy algorithms skips that part.
